Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)

X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using triangles.txt, a text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, 
find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
